Hey there!
I am learning to type in sulime text.
I am learning the editor as well.
Maybe I'll learn Git too.
Is that too much to do at a time?

I was hoping to learn about Linux and its commaned line too.
So much to do, with so little time.

Today I have completed 6 months at my first job.
Maybe I will add this new thing to my routine, try to learn a little bit each day and document it too.

Here is what all I did today.
	* Installed Sublime Text 3 in my Ubuntu OS
	* Learned about the 'subl' command which can be used from the command line to 
		- run sublime text editor (subl)
		- open a file in the current directory with sublime (subl <filename>)
		- create a new file in the current direrctory using sublime (subl <new_filename>)
	* Created a new local git repo and commited today's journal
	* Uploaded it to GitHub

This is what I need to find tommorow
	* How to put bullets in sublime 
	* How to turn off the mouse pad (it's irritating as i keep touching the pad and dislocating my cursor :-| )
	* How to do spell check in sublime.
	* explore 'subl' to make it work with in Windows

Hope to see ya tommorow. Tata!
